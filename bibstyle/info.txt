to generate a custom bst file the ubuntu package 
texlive-bibtex-extra
is needed

Just run
 latex makebst
and answer quite a lot of questions (help can be found here [http://www.medicalnerds.com/latex-bibliography-management-and-styles/]). This produces a batch (.dbj) file, that can be converted into a bibtex style if you say so at the last question, or by manually running latex FILENAME you chose)

If you want to re-run it with only little changes, you might prefer to edit the batchfile insteat...
