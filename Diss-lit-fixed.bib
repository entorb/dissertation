This high lifetime is attributed to a combination of the low current density needed to reach a certain luminance and to the high stability of the materials against both charge carriers and excitons.},

abstract = {Organic semiconductors are a novel materials class which has recently been investigated in detail due to the very promising applications possibilities. In contrast to the classical inorganic semiconductors, which are usually used in single-crystalline forms, organic semiconductors consisting of either oligomer or polymer chain molecules are typically deposited as thin films on large areas leading to amorphous or polycrystalline structures. Since flexible and transparent substrates can be used, organic electronics open many new application and integration perspectives. With contributions from chemistry, physics, and engineering, organic semiconductors are an archetype for an interdisciplinary field. Organic semiconductors are characterized by the comparatively weak van der Waals bonding, leading to soft materials and narrow energy bands. In single crystals, band transport has been observed. In thin films, however, disorder plays an important role and hopping transport with mobilities well below 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 is typically observed. The optical properties are characterized by high absorption and emission rates, induced by the highly polarizable $\pi$-electronic systems and the large electron-hole correlation leading to exciton binding energies of about 0.5 eV. In this chapter, we address the basic properties of organic semiconductors, in particular their transport and optical properties. Then, we discuss device applications, with the goal to work out the basic principles of device operation and describe the current state of the art.},

abstract = {emperature-activated charge transport in disordered organic semiconductors at large carrier concentrations, especially relevant in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), has been thoroughly considered using a recently developed analytical formalism assuming a Gaussian density-of-states (DOS) distribution and Miller-Abrahams jump rates. We demonstrate that the apparent Meyer-Neldel compensation rule (MNR) is recovered regarding the temperature dependences of the charge carrier mobility upon varying the carrier concentration but not regarding varying the width of the DOS. We show that establishment of the MNR is a characteristic signature of hopping transport in a random system with variable carrier concentration. The polaron formation was not involved to rationalize this phenomenon. The MNR effect has been studied in a OFET based on C60 films, a material with negligible electron-phonon coupling, and successfully described by the present model. We show that this phenomenon is entirely due to the evolution of the occupational DOS profile upon increasing carrier concentration and this mechanism is specific to materials with Gaussian-shaped DOS. The suggested model provides compact analytical relations which can be readily used for the evaluation of important material parameters from experimentally accessible data on temperature dependence of the mobility in organic electronic devices. Experimental results on temperature-dependent charge mobility reported before for organic semiconductors by other authors can be well interpreted by using the model presented in this paper. In addition, the presented analytical formalism predicts a transition to a Mott-type charge carrier hopping regime at very low temperatures, which also manifests a MNR effect.},

abstract = {The development of white organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) holds great promise for the production of highly efficient large-area light sources. High internal quantum efficiencies for the conversion of electrical energy to light have been realized. Nevertheless, the overall device power efficiencies are still considerably below the 60-70 lumens per watt of fluorescent tubes, which is the current benchmark for novel light sources. Although some reports about highly power-efficient white OLEDs exist, details about structure and the measurement conditions of these structures have not been fully disclosed: the highest power efficiency reported in the scientific literature is 44 lm W(-1) (ref. 7). Here we report an improved OLED structure which reaches fluorescent tube efficiency. By combining a carefully chosen emitter layer with high-refractive-index substrates, and using a periodic outcoupling structure, we achieve a device power efficiency of 90 lm W(-1) at 1,000 candelas per square metre. This efficiency has the potential to be raised to 124 lm W(-1) if the light outcoupling can be further improved. Besides approaching internal quantum efficiency values of one, we have also focused on reducing energetic and ohmic losses that occur during electron-photon conversion. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for further research, leading to white OLEDs having efficiencies beyond 100 lm W(-1). This could make white-light OLEDs, with their soft area light and high colour-rendering qualities, the light sources of choice for the future.},

@article{Gregg2004Review,
abstract = {A heuristic approach to describing excitonic processes, doping, and transport is developed for all organic semiconductors but with an emphasis on crystalline molecular semiconductors. A simple equation is proposed that semiquantitatively defines “excitonic” semiconductors, XSCs, a classification that includes most organic semiconductors and some inorganic materials. The same electrostatic and spatial factors that cause exciton formation upon light absorption in XSCs, as opposed to the formation of free electron−hole pairs, also control the doping process and carrier transport. Doping studies of XSCs are reviewed with an emphasis on the more recent, quantitative investigations. One conclusion is that most added charge carriers in doped XSCs are not free but rather are electrostatically bound to their conjugate dopant counterions. A superlinear increase in conductivity with doping density is thus expected to be, and apparently is, a universal attribute of XSCs. The interactions between the crystal structure, its dielectric properties, and the doping efficiency are probed via two substitutional dopant molecules in two different crystalline host lattices. An analogy is drawn between purposely doped XSCs and adventitiously doped XSCs such as $\pi$-conjugated polymers: in both cases the number of free carriers is a small, and field-dependent, fraction of the total carrier density. The Poole-Frenkel mechanism accounts naturally for the expected interactions between carriers bound in a Coulomb well and an applied electric field. Together with a field-dependent mobility, this mechanism is expected to semiquantitatively describe the conductivity in doped XSCs.},

We observe the presence of polycrystalline and amorphous domains within the doped pentacene film grown under co-deposition conditions. The appearance of the amorphous phase is induced by the molecular dopants F4-TCNQ and F6-TCNNQ. A strong drop of crystallite size is obtained at a doping concentration of around 7 and 4 wt.\%, respectively. The loss of the polycrystalline structure is correlated to a strong decrease of the charge carrier mobility in pentacene in horizontal and vertical film structures. We discuss typical scenarios of charge transport for polycrystalline and amorphous thin films in order to explain the observed loss of mobility originated by the doping induced structural phase transition. In this way an optimum doping concentration for highest conductivity with acceptable mobility is determined which can help to improve the performance of organic solar cells and organic high-frequency rectification diodes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss recent experiments which prove that evaporated organic films can be efficiently doped by co-evaporation with organic dopant molecules. Key advantages for devices are the high conductivity and the formation of ohmic contacts despite large energetic barriers. For p-type doping, efficient doping is possible for a variety of polycrystalline and amorphous materials. Despite the differences in the microscopic behavior, all basic effects known from doped inorganic semiconductors are found in organics as well. However, efficient n-type doping with stable molecular dopants is still a challenge. Organic light emitting diodes (OLED) with conductivity doped transport layers show significantly improved properties: For instance, we have achieved a brightness of 100 cd/m(2) already at a voltage of 2.55 V, well below previous results for undoped devices. The advantages of doping are even more pronounced for top-emitting, inverted OLED structures: Due to the ohmic contacts nearly independent of the contact properties, it is possible to realize inverted top-emitting devices with parameters comparable to standard devices. Our doping technology is thus a significant advantage for active-matrix OLED displays and other displays on opaque substrate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigate, at the molecular scale, surface and subsurface tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane p-dopants in the prototypical molecular semiconductor pentacene. Surface dopants diffuse to pentacene vacancies and appear as negatively charged centers, consistent with the standard picture of an ionized acceptor. Subsurface dopants, however, have the effect of a positive charge, evidence that the donated hole is localized by the parent acceptor counterion, in contrast to the model of doping in inorganic semiconductors. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy shows that the electron potential energy is locally lowered near a subsurface dopant feature, in agreement with the localized hole model.},

Here we report the preparation of alkali-metal-doped films of C60 and C70 which have electrical conductivities at room temperature that are comparable to those attained by n-type doped polyacetylene. The highest conductivities observed in the doped films are: 4Scm−1 (Cs/C60), 100 (Rb/C60), 500 (K/C60), 20 (Na/C60), 10 (Li/C60), 2 (K/C70). The doping process is reversed on exposure of the films to the atmosphere. At high doping levels, the films become more resistive. We attribute the conductivity induced in these films to the formation of energy bands from the $\pi$ orbitals of C60 or C70, which become partially filled with carriers on doping. The smaller alkali metal ions should be able to fit into the interstices in the lattice without disrupting the network of contacts between the carbon spheroids. In the case of C60, this would allow the development of an isotropic band structure, and we therefore propose that these materials may constitute the first three-dimensional 'organic' conductors.},

The term p-i-n means here a layer sequence in the form p-doped layer, intrinsic layer and n-doped layer. The doping is realized by controlled co-evaporation using organic dopants and leads to conductivities of 10-4 to 10-5 S/cm in the p- and n-doped wide-gap layers, respectively. The photoactive layer is formed by a mixture of phthalocyanine zinc (ZnPc) and the fullerene C60 and shows mainly amorphous morphology. As a first step towards p-i-n structures, we show the advantage of using wide-gap layers in M-i-p-type diodes (metal layer-intrinsic layer-p-doped layer). The solar cells exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 40\% between 630-nm and 700-nm wavelength. With the help of an optical multilayer model, we optimize the optical properties of the solar cells by placing the active region at the maximum of the optical field distribution. The results of the model are largely confirmed by the experimental findings. For an optically optimized device, we find an internal quantum efficiency of around 82\% under short-circuit conditions. Adding a layer of 10-nm thickness of the red material N,N-dimethylperylene-3,4:9,10-dicarboximide (Me-PTCDI) to the active region, a power-conversion efficiency of 1.9\% for a single cell is obtained. Such optically thin cells with high internal quantum efficiency are an important step towards high-efficiency tandem cells. First tandem cells which are not yet optimized already show 2.4\% power-conversion efficiency under simulated AM 1.5 illumination of 125 mW/cm2 .},

Doping of such materials increases the density of carriers but also creates deep Coulomb traps. The net effect is typically a decreasing mobility at low doping levels. At high doping levels the Coulomb traps overlap spatially, which leads to smoothening of the potential landscape and to strongly increasing mobility. The model is used to fit experimental data on the mobility in electrochemically (EC) doped polythiophenes. It also explains why increasing the carrier density by the field-effect results in a much higher mobility than an equivalent increase of the carrier density by EC doping.},

abstract = {In recent decades, a number of molecules and diverse dust features have been identified by astronomical observations in various environments. Most of the dust that determines the physical and chemical characteristics of the interstellar medium is formed in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars and is further processed when these objects become planetary nebulae. We studied the environment of Tc 1, a peculiar planetary nebula whose infrared spectrum shows emission from cold and neutral C60 and C70. The two molecules amount to a few percent of the available cosmic carbon in this region. This finding indicates that if the conditions are right, fullerenes can and do form efficiently in space.},

Varying the doping concentration, photoemission spectroscopy measurements show a comparable Fermi level shift for both dopants. The doping efficiency, defined as the ratio of free charge carriers (holes) to acceptors, is estimated from the depletion layer thickness in metal/intrinsic/p-doped structures. For low concentrations, we observe rather high doping efficiencies of up to 36\% for C60F36, whereas for both dopants the doping efficiency strongly decreases with increasing doping concentration down to less than 10\%. By numerically solving the charge neutrality equation using a classical semiconductor physics approach and comparing the results to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy data, we show that for very low concentrations doping is hindered by deep intragap states. In particular, the calculations can statistically explain the strong decrease of the doping efficiency for high doping concentrations.},

Owing to its large work function, WO3 allows for efficient electron transfer from organic semiconductors with HOMO levels in this region. The effect of p-type doping is evidenced by optical absorption spectroscopy, electrical transport characteristics and Kelvin probe analysis. Moreover, OLED devices have been realized which exhibit 30\% enhanced power efficiency due to the p-type doping.

The coefficient decreased with increasing P concentration, and with a peak of the Seebeck coefficient around 5×1019 cm−3. We calculated the density-of-states (DOS) of bulk Si based on theoretical models of impurity-band formation, ionization-energy shift, and conduction-band tailing. The calculated impurity-concentration dependence of the energy derivative of the DOS at the Fermi energy also showed a peak. Consequently, the Seebeck coefficient of the heavily doped Si is ruled by the DOS distribution, similar to metallic materials.},

abstract = {We present a study on n doping of C-60 thin films by acridine orange base [3,6-bis(dimethylamino)acridine(AOB)] combining conductivity, field effect, and Seebeck measurements. An increase of more than six orders of magnitude in conductivity is observed for a doping ratio of 6 mol \%, accompanied by a decrease in the activation energy from 0.64 to 0.15 eV compared to the undoped C-60. We observe a clear doping effect immediately after sample preparation, but also a further activation by annealing or illumination. The field effect and Seebeck measurements confirm n-type conduction of C-60 thin films and show that deep donor states are formed in AOB-doped C-60 thin films. A field effect mobility of 0.2 cm(2)/V s is achieved for a doping level of 1.8 mol \%. Near Infrared (NIR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra demonstrate electron transfer from the dopant to the matrix: For C-60 doped with AOB, C-60(-) is present in NIR absorption and FTIR spectra. On the other hand, a peak corresponding to acridine orange [3,6-bis(dimethylamino)acridinium chloride (AOBH(+))] is also observed in the FTIR spectrum of C-60:AOB, where AOBH(+) corresponds to AOB with one additional proton attached. Electrochemical data of AOB and AOBH(+) in acetontrile suggest that the AOB radical cation is not stable, but is rapidly transformed into a compound with similar properties to AOBH(+). Conductivities of C-60 thin films doped with bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene were also investigated to confirm that the doping effect of AOB in C-60 does not result from a simple electron transfer from AOB to C-60.},

abstract = {The conversion of sunlight into electricity has been dominated by photovoltaic and solar thermal power generation. Photovoltaic cells are deployed widely, mostly as flat panels, whereas solar thermal electricity generation relying on optical concentrators and mechanical heat engines is only seen in large-scale power plants. Here we demonstrate a promising flat-panel solar thermal to electric power conversion technology based on the Seebeck effect and high thermal concentration, thus enabling wider applications. The developed solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) achieved a peak efficiency of 4.6\% under AM1.5G (1 kW m−2) conditions. The efficiency is 7-8 times higher than the previously reported best value for a flat-panel STEG, and is enabled by the use of high-performance nanostructured thermoelectric materials and spectrally-selective solar absorbers in an innovative design that exploits high thermal concentration in an evacuated environment. Our work opens up a promising new approach which has the potential to achieve cost-effective conversion of solar energy into electricity.},

abstract = {n-Doping of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), which has an electron affinity (EA) of 3.52 eV, by decamethylcobaltocene (DMC) is demonstrated. DMC has a remarkably low solid-state ionization energy (IE) of 3.3 eV, as measured by ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). Further UPS measurements show a large 1.4 eV upward shift of the Fermi-level within the single particle gap of CuPc between the p- and n-doped films. n-Doping is also confirmed by current-voltage (I-V) measurements, which show a 106-fold increase in current density due to improved electron injection and enhanced conductivity of the bulk film. An organic p-i-n CuPc homojunction is also fabricated using F4-TCNQ and DMC as p- and n-dopants, respectively. Current-voltage characteristics demonstrate excellent rectification with a turn on voltage of approximately 1.3 eV, which is consistent with the built-in voltage measured by UPS and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements.},

Large values of Seebeck voltage believed to be caused by the type of phonon-electron coupling previously postulated as occurring in germanium have been found. This effect is found to be dependent upon charge carrier concentration, and upon sample dimension below 100°K. A low-temperature reversal of the sign of the Seebeck voltage is observed for large carrier concentrations. It is understandable in terms of impurity band conduction. The behavior above room temperature into the intrinsic range is found to be consistent with electrical conductivity data.},

abstract = {The effect of doping on the density-of-states (DOS) distribution and charge-carrier transport in a disordered hopping system is considered analytically. It is shown that doping such a system produces a random distribution of dopant ions, which Coulombically interact with carriers localized in intrinsic hopping sites. This interaction further increases the energy disorder and broadens the deep tail of the DOS distribution. Therefore, doping of a disordered organic semiconductor, on the one hand, increases the concentration of charge carriers and lifts up the Fermi level but, on the other hand, creates additional deep Coulombic traps of the opposite polarity. While the former effect facilitates conductivity, the latter strongly suppresses the carrier hopping rate. A model of hopping in a doped disordered organic semiconductor is suggested. It is shown that the doping efficiency strongly depends upon the energy disorder and external electric field.},

The TSC results demonstrate that the absorption of O2 and H2O molecules in the C60 films induced an increase in the electron trap concentration, which degrades C60 FET characteristics. By annealing the C60 films at 100 °C for 8 h, the electron trap concentrations were markedly lowered, enhancing the C60 FET characteristics. An electron mobility of 0.017 cm2/V s and a current on/off ratio of 106 were observed from the degassed C60 FETs.},

We observed that the binding energy position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of pentacene becomes significantly lower on CuPc and SiO2 surfaces than that on graphite. Furthermore, a splitting of the UPS band was observed only for the HOMO of thicker crystalline films on CuPc and SiO2 surfaces, where the molecules are oriented with their long axis nearly perpendicular to the substrate surface. The splitting is ascribed to the intermolecular band dispersion, and the decrease in the threshold ionization energy on CuPc and SiO2 surfaces originates from the HOMO-band dispersion as well as the increase in the relaxation/polarization energies, which may be caused by the better molecular packing structure with a nearly standing molecular orientation.},

When plotted as a function of pyrolysis temperature the resistivity shows a maximum in the region 200-300°. Although the resistivity of the polymers prepared at 120° and 500° is roughly similar, their e.s.r. behaviour is quite different. The low-temperature polymer, containing much complexed iodine, shows a very broad signal arising from an excited state probably associated with a polypyrrole-iodine charge-transfer complex; the high temperature polymer, containing no iodine, shows a strong narrow signal arising from the ground state of the polymer. The changes in conductivity of the polymers following the adsorption of electron acceptor or donor molecules have been measured. It is concluded that, depending on the relative amounts of electron donating or attracting chemisorbed species in relation to the concentration of donor nitrogen atoms in the polypyrrole, the polymer may behave as an intrinsic or extrinsic semiconductor with n- or p-type characteristics. Charge-transfer complexes of strength sufficient to cause partial ionization induce extrinsic behaviour by changing the ratio of the number of electrons to the number of holes. Substituent groups such as the hetero atoms which interact with the $\pi$-electron system inductively or through resonance affect only the relative mobility of the charge carriers and induce intrinsic behaviour.},

abstract = {A detailed approach to the complex hopping transport in organic semiconductors is presented and used to describe experimental data from Maennig [Phys. Rev. B 64, 195208 (2001)] on the effect of doping on conductivity, mobility and thermopower. In this approach, the energetic distribution of the charge carriers in a Gaussian shaped density of states (DOS) is calculated under thermal equilibrium conditions and compared to the energetic distribution of the current. The description is based on the Miller-Abraham model for hopping in a disordered material and utilizes the so-called transport energy concept. To include also the case of higher electron concentrations in the tail states of the DOS the Fermi distribution was taken into account. Furthermore, additional trap states in the gap are considered to describe the experimental data at low doping concentration more correctly. In the framework of the model there is no indication of a thermally activated ionization of the dopants. In contrast to other descriptions, the position of the Fermi energy and transport energy are calculated from the model. It is demonstrated that the principal behavior of the transport parameter can be well explained in terms of classical semiconductor physics. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

This means that an increasing doping concentration not only increases the number of carriers, but also decreases the activation energy for the carriers to reach the transport states resulting in an easier escape and there- with the superlinear increase of conductivity

m\"{u}ssen also irgendwo in dieser Zustandsdichte verteilt existieren. Die Verteilung
innerhalb der Zustandsdichte wird durch die Verteilungsfunktion f (Fermi-Verteilung) 
beschrieben. Diese ist aber temperaturabh\"{a}ngig. Da umgekehrt aber die Zahl der Ladungstr\"{a}ger
im System insgesamt sich mit der Temperatur nicht \"{a}ndert-das Integral also temperaturunabh\"{a}ngig
sein muss, ergibt sich daraus eine Bestimmungsgleichung f\"{u}r das elektrochemische Potential,
das hier vielleicht nicht ganz konform "Fermi-Energie" genannt wird. EF (eigentlich besser
das elektrochemische Potential) ist also derart temperaturabh\"{a}ngig, dass das Integral als Ganzes temperaturunabh\"{a}ngig wird.

A common method for patterning consists of using a protective layer and etching the uncovered small molecule film by oxygen plasma. One of the handicaps of this process is the observed degradation of the transistor characteristics. By varying the resist overlap, the authors show that the main cause of this performance degradation is, in fact, a far-reaching underetch of the oxygen plasma which can be overcome by choosing the right geometry of the resist pattern.},

Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy show Fermi level (E F) shifts toward unoccupied pentacene states, indicative of an increase in the electron concentration. A 1\% donor incorporation level brings E\_F to 0.6 eV below the pentacene lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. The corresponding electron density of 1E-18 cm−3 is confirmed by capacitance–voltage measurements on a metal–pentacene–oxide–silicon structure.

abstract = {The generation of electric voltage by placing a conductor in a temperature gradient is called the Seebeck effect. Its efficiency is represented by the Seebeck coefficient, S, which is defined as the ratio of the generated electric voltage to the temperature difference, and is determined by the scattering rate and the density of the conduction electrons. The effect can be exploited, for example, in thermal electric-power generators and for temperature sensing, by connecting two conductors with different Seebeck coefficients, a device called a thermocouple. Here we report the observation of the thermal generation of driving power, or voltage, for electron spin: the spin Seebeck effect. Using a recently developed spin-detection technique that involves the spin Hall effect, we measure the spin voltage generated from a temperature gradient in a metallic magnet. This thermally induced spin voltage persists even at distances far from the sample ends, and spins can be extracted from every position on the magnet simply by attaching a metal. The spin Seebeck effect observed here is directly applicable to the production of spin-voltage generators, which are crucial for driving spintronic devices. The spin Seebeck effect allows us to pass a pure spin current, a flow of electron spins without electric currents, over a long distance. These innovative capabilities will invigorate spintronics research.},

In the case of the treatment by positive oxygen ions with kinetic energy of 50 eV, the luminance increased markedly with a lowering of the operating voltage in the organic light emitting diode (OLED). The change in the device characteristics was attributed to an effective removal of organic contaminants from the ITO surface, leading to enhanced hole injection from ITO to a hole transport layer (HTL) due to an increase in work function of the ITO. Moreover, the highest luminance and luminous efficiency were obtained in the OLED having HTL with ionization potential of 5.4 eV. These results have suggested that OLEDs fabricated using the oxygen plasma treated ITO can give the best device performance by the selection of an optimum HTL.},

abstract = {The addition of ortho‐chloranil to the surface of films of metal‐free phthalocyanine has been found (a) to increase the dark conductivity of such films by as much as 107, (b) to increase the steady‐state photoconductivity by as much as 105, and (c) to result in the formation of unpaired electrons whose concentration decreases reversibly as a result of illumination. These systems exhibit a light‐induced polarization, the phthalocyanine layer becoming more positive with respect to the ortho‐chloranil layer. Kinetic studies demonstrate that, upon illumination, a single process (time constant=60 sec) results in the increase in conductivity, the decrease in unpaired spins and the increase in polarization. The results are consistent with the following scheme. An electron transfer from phthalocyanine to ortho‐chloranil occurs in the dark at room temperature producing holes in the phthalocyanine layer and ortho‐chloranil negative ion radicals (high conductivity, ESR signal). Illumination results in the transfer of an electron from an excited phthalocyanine molecule to the ortho‐chloranil negative ion producing further phthalocyanine holes and ortho‐chloranil double negative ion (increase in conductivity, increase in polarization, decrease in ESR signal). By equating spin concentration with charge carrier concentration (phthalocyanine holes) it is possible to calculate a mobility of 10‐4 cm2/v/sec for holes in the phthalocyanine layer. With this value, a quantum yield of unity is calculated for the production of charge carriers in doped phthalocyanine. The experiments indicate a quantum yield of less than 10‐1 for undoped phthalocyanine. The over‐all results of adding a strong electron acceptor to a film of phthalocyanine are thus to (a) produce charge carriers in the dark, (b) increase the quantum yield for production of charge carriers by light and (c) increase charge carrier lifetime.},

The films are electrically characterized in situ by temperature dependent conductivity and Seebeck and field-effect measurements. In addition to previous work, we show that also amorphous phthalocyanine layers can be doped, i.e., their conductivity increases and their Seebeck coefficient decreases indicating a shift of the Fermi level towards the hole transport level. The field-effect mobility of the polycrystalline samples is in the range of 10(-4)-10(-3) cm(-2)/Vs and increases with increasing dopant concentration.

abstract = {We present an approach to stable n-type doping of organic matrices using organic dopands. To circumvent stability limitations inherent in strong organic donors, we produce the donor from a stable precursor compound in situ. As an example, pyronin B chloride is studied as a dopant in a 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride matrix. Conductivities up to 2x10(-4) S/cm are obtained, which is two orders of magnitude higher than obtained previously using bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene as a dopant \{[\}A. Nollau, M. Pfeiffer, T. Fritz, and K. Leo, J. Appl. Phys. 87, 4340 (2000)]. Field-effect measurements are used to prove n-type conduction. Other matrices which can be doped are N,N'-dimethyl-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide and fullerene C60, frequently used in organic solar cells.

In our approach the volatile donor (or the corresponding cation itself) is created in situ from a stable precursor compound.11 For example, one can form a radical that has to be stable enough to be incorporated on the layer.
        
When the samples are exposed to air, the conductivity vanishes,indicating compensation by oxygen in a n-type semiconductor. The effect of air is reversible.

Taking advantage of such high work function anode interfacial layer on ITO, enhanced performance of a chloroaluminium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc)/fullerene (C60) planar heterojunction based organic solar cell was observed.

abstract = {Recent computer simulations have shown that the temperature dependence of the charge-carrier mobility in an amorphous organic hopping system, where the profile of the energy distribution of the hopping sites is a Gaussian, should follow $\mu$(T)=$\mu$0exp[-(T0/T)2]. T0 is proportional to the Gaussian width $\sigma$. Experimental data obtained for the hole mobility in a variety of organic glasses confirm this relationship and yield $\sigma$ values on the order 0.1 eV and $\mu$0 values on the order 10-2 cm2/V s. Changes of the $\mu$(T) dependence observed near the glass transition temperature are attributed to an increase of $\sigma$ above Tg as a result of dynamic disorder superimposed on the static fluctuations of site energies. The model predicts a field dependence of $\mu$ of the form $\mu$(E)=$\mu$(E=0)exp(E/E0) which is observed. Agreement between simulation results and experiment is excellent. It demonstrates that the field dependence of $\mu$ is an inherent consequence of hopping transport in a system subject to a Gaussian type of diagonal disorder. No charged trap states have to be invoked.},

The spectroelectrochemical studies of cation radicals, dications, and tetracations indicate a strong difference in stability of higher ions of two model compounds with different phenyl substitution. In cyclovoltammetry the small peak separation of the first two oxidation peaks for both compounds points to a small energetic difference in the first two electron transfers, while the peak separation of the second and third peak is quite large. A well resolved ESR spectrum of the B(*+) cation radical with dominating splittings from two nitrogen atoms is observed and an ESR silent product was determined at the third oxidation peak for both compounds, confirming the formation of a tetracation by a two electron transfer at the third voltammetric peak. In contrast to structure A a more complex redox behavior was found for B under voltammetric cycling. The reaction mechanism indicates the transformation of B in a new product P with a carbazole moiety. This compound can form a highly stabilized cation radical P(*+). A theoretical study based on density functional theory calculations has clarified the role of charging in changes to the structures of both triarylamine derivatives A and B.},

abstract = {Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are expected to be a low cost, environmentally friendly energy solution with advantageous properties such as flexibility and light weight that enable their use in new applications. Considerable progress in power conversion efficiencies has brought OPV technology closer to commercialization. However, little consideration has been given to potential environmental impact associated with their production. Although environmental life cycle studies of OPV exist, their scope is narrow or too reliant on outdated technologies. Some of the most significant recent improvements are the result of new semiconductors materials, which have not yet been assessed from a life cycle perspective. Therefore, this study calculates life cycle embodied energy for 15 new materials encompassing a variety of donor, acceptor, and interface compounds showing the most promise in organic electronics. With the use of new inventory data, life cycle energy impact associated with production of both single junction and multi-junction architectures has been calculated including bulk heterojunction polymer, planar small molecule, and planar-mixed small molecule devices. The cumulative energy demand (CED) required to fabricate small molecule and polymer photovoltaics were found to be similar from 2.9 to 5.7 MJ/Wp. This CED is on average of 50\% less than for conventional inorganic photovoltaics, motivating the continued development of both technologies. The use of fullerenes was shown to have a dramatic impact on polymer solar cells, comprising 18-30\% of the CED, despite only being present in small quantities. Increases in device efficiency are shown to marginally reduce CED for both small molecule and polymer designs.},

abstract = {The stabilization of future CO2 atmospheric concentrations to levels that might prevent anthropogenic alterations of the world climate calls for tens of terawatts of carbon free renewable energy resources. The combined energy production potential of all known non-solar carbon-free renewable resources seems insufficient to meet these targets. Consequently, over the next decades solar energy, and in particular photovoltaics, is expected to fill the gap. In this work several mature photovoltaic technologies, ranging from silicon to thin films, and solar concentrator systems are analyzed. The estimates of the energy production limits are established for each technology, based on available global material reserves. It is shown that many existing technologies, albeit playing an important in the present sub-gigawatt energy production levels, are affected by severe material shortages, that would prevent their scale-up to the terawatt range. This is the case for thin film solar cells technologies based on CdTe and CIGS where the showstopper is the scarcity of tellurium and indium respectively. Despite the abundance of silicon, crystalline Si-based solar cells will hardly reach the terawatt range as additional scale-up of the technology will be impeded by the global reserves of silver, commonly used as electrode material. As for amorphous silicon and dye sensitized thin film technologies, avoiding the use of indium tin oxide transparent conductor films appears as a must for exceeding the few tenth of terawatt barrier. For existing III-V concentrator cells, operating under moderate concentration (<200X), terawatt year level may be afforded by circumventing the use of Ge substrates and by minimizing the use of In and Au in the cell fabrication process.},

As a basic transport property of solids, the Seebeck coefficient S provides deep insight as it is given by the entropy transported by thermally excited charge carriers and involves in the simplest case only electronic contributions where the transported entropy is determined by details of the band structure and scattering events. We have succeeded for the first time to measure the temperature- and carrier-density-dependent thermopower in single crystals and thin films of two prototypical organic semiconductors by a controlled modulation of the chemical potential in a field-effect geometry. Surprisingly, we find the Seebeck coefficient to be well within the range of the electronic contribution in conventional inorganic semiconductors, highlighting the similarity of transport mechanisms in organic and inorganic semiconductors. Charge and entropy transport is best described as band-like transport of quasiparticles that are subjected to scattering, with exponentially distributed in-gap trap states, and without further contributions to S.},

abstract = {The understanding and applications of organic semiconductors have shown remarkable progress in recent years. This material class has been developed from being a lab curiosity to the basis of first successful products as small organic LED (OLED) displays; other areas of application such as OLED lighting and organic photovoltaics are on the verge of broad commercialization. Organic semiconductors are superior to inorganic ones for low-cost and large-area optoelectronics due to their flexibility, easy deposition, and broad variety, making tailor-made materials possible. However, electrical doping of organic semiconductors, i.e. the controlled adjustment of Fermi level that has been extremely important to the success of inorganic semiconductors, is still in its infancy. This review will discuss recent work on both fundamental principles and applications of doping, focused primarily to doping of evaporated organic layers with molecular dopants. Recently, both p- and n-type molecular dopants have been developed that lead to efficient and stable doping of organic thin films. Due to doping, the conductivity of the doped layers increases several orders of magnitude and allows for quasi-Ohmic contacts between organic layers and metal electrodes. Besides reducing voltage losses, doping thus also gives design freedom in terms of transport layer thickness and electrode choice. The use of doping in applications like OLEDs and organic solar cells is highlighted in this review. Overall, controlled molecular doping can be considered as key enabling technology for many different organic device types that can lead to significant improvements in efficiencies and lifetimes.},

abstract = {High resolution synchrotron-based core level spectroscopy was used to examine the energy level alignment at the interface of zinc-tetraphenylporphyrin films doped by the surface acceptor C60F48. Two distinct fluorofullerene charge states were identified, corresponding to ionized and neutral molecules, and their relative concentration as a function of coverage was used to evaluate the probability of occupation of the acceptor lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). From an initial acceptor energy of −0.25 eV, the C60F48 LUMO shifts upwards with coverage due to a doping-induced interfacial dipole potential, and stabilization of the LUMO at an energy 0.45 eV above the Fermi energy was obtained. While the energy difference upon saturation is consistent with the results obtained for other donor-acceptor systems that have been interpreted as Fermi level pinning, the present work shows that the energy offset is a direct consequence of the interplay between Fermi-Dirac statistics in combination with the interfacial dipole potential.},

Purification of 1a and 1b is achieved by sublimation of the excess Hhpp and subsequent recrystallization from either CH(2)Cl(2) or CHCl(3) (or CDCl(3)). By single-crystal X-ray crystallography, the structures of 1a and 1b are shown to contain a central paddlewheel-like M(2)(hpp)(4) core with Mo-Mo = 2.1708(8) A (from CH(2)Cl(2)), 2.1574(5) A (from CDCl(3)), W-W = 2.2328(2) A (from CDCl(3)), and M-N = 2.09(1) (av) A. The Cl ligands are axially ligated (linear Cl-M-M-Cl) with abnormally long M-Cl bond distances that, in turn, depend on the presence or absence of hydrogen bonding to chloroform. The quadruply bonded compounds M(2)(hpp)(4), 2a (M = Mo), and 2b (M = W), can be prepared from the reactions between 1,2-M(2)R(2)(NMe(2))(4) compounds, where R = (i)()Bu or p-tolyl, and Hhpp (4 equiv) in benzene by ligand replacement and reductive elimination. The compounds 2a and 2b are readily oxidized, and in chloroform they react to form 1a and 1b, respectively. The electronic structure and bonding in the compounds 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b have been investigated using gradient corrected density functional theory employing Gaussian 98. The bonding in the M-M quadruply bonded compounds, 2a and 2b, reveals M-M delta(2) HOMOs and extensive mixing of M-M pi and nitrogen ligand lone-pair orbitals in a manner qualitatively similar to that of the M(2)(formamidinates)(4). The calculations indicate that in the chloride compounds, 1a and 1b, the HOMO is strongly M-Cl sigma antibonding and weakly M-M sigma bonding in character. Formally there is a M-M triple bond of configuration pi(4)sigma(2), and the LUMO is the M-M delta orbital. An interesting mixing of M-M and M-Cl pi interactions occurs, and an enlightening analogy emerges between these d(4)-d(4) and d(3)-d(3) dinuclear compounds and the bonding in C(2), C(2)H(2), and C(2)Cl(2), which is interrogated herein by simple theoretical calculations together with the potential bonding in axially ligated compounds where strongly covalent M-X bonds are present. The latter were represented by the model compounds M(2)(hpp)(4)(H)(2). On the basis of calculations, we estimate the reactions M(2)(hpp)(4) + X(2) to give M(2)(hpp)(4)X(2) to be enthalpically favorable for X = Cl but not for X = H. These results are discussed in terms of the recent work of Cotton and Murillo and our attempts to prepare parallel-linked oligomers of the type [[bridge]-[M(2)]-](n)().},

abstract = {The use of polymer materials for photovoltaic applications is expected to have several advantages over current crystalline silicon technology. In this paper, we perform an environmental and economic assessment of polymer-based thin film modules with a glass substrate and modules with a flexible substrate and we compare our results with literature data for multicrystalline (mc-) silicon photovoltaics and other types of PV. The functional unit of this study is ‘25 years of electricity production by PV systems with a power of 1 watt-peak (Wp)’. Because the lifetime of polymer photovoltaics is at present much lower than of mc-silicon photovoltaics, we first compared the PV cells per watt-peak and next determined the minimum required lifetime of polymer PV to arrive at the same environmental impacts as mc-silicon PV. We found that per watt-peak of output power, the environmental impacts compared to mc-silicon are 20-60\% lower for polymer PV systems with glass substrate and 80-95\% lower for polymer PV with PET as substrate (flexible modules). Also in comparison with thin film CuInSe and thin film silicon, the impacts of polymer modules, per watt-peak, appeared to be lower. The costs per watt-peak of polymer PV modules with glass substrate are approximately 20\% higher compared to mc-silicon photovoltaics. However, taking into account uncertainties, this might be an overestimation. For flexible modules, no cost data were available. If the efficiency and lifetime of polymer PV modules increases, both glass-based and flexible polymer PV could become an environment friendly and cheap alternative to mc-silicon PV},

This is the first direct observation of emission from states thought to be important for conduction in conducting polymers. While EELS also implies the formation of gap states their evolution with doping cannot be simply interpreted. The valence-band emissions clearly show shifts in the Fermi level due to pinning by the bipolaron states and movements due to increased polarizability on the formation of the Cs-biphenyl complex.},

These cover respectively the temperature and compositional dependences of conductivity, and non-additive behaviour such as the mixed alkali effect. Some aspects of glass behaviour are apparently ‘universal’ in the sense that they show little sensitivity to changes in short-range structural order. It is argued here that a recently proposed cluster bypass model (in which pathways for ion migration are located within ‘connective tissue’ surrounding ordered microdomains or clusters) provides a straightforward explanation for all these characteristics of vitreous electrolytes. It also provides a framework for more detailed discussions of conduction mechanisms in the context of percolation theory.},

Here, we report the synthesis, as well as photophysical and electroluminescent properties, of an organic molecular p-type conductivity dopant: 1,3,4,5,7,8-hexafluorotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F6-TNAP). F6-TNAP was obtained in a three-step two-pot synthesis from commercially available octafluoronaphthalene. When 1\%−5\% of F6-TNAP was coevaporated with N,N′-di-1-naphthyl-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′diamine ($\alpha$-NPD) an absorption band at 950 nm was formed, which is attributed to charge transfer and assigned to the F6-TNAP radical anion. Single-carrier (hole-only) devices fabricated with F6-TNAP doped into $\alpha$-NPD as the hole transport layer (HTL) show a >2 V decrease in operating voltage, compared to the undoped device. A decrease in operating voltage was also demonstrated in blue OLED devices using a F6-TNAP-doped HTL, with only a slight decrease in external quantum efficiency, thus resulting in a net improvement in power efficiency. These results demonstrate that F6-TNAP may be useful in generating high-efficiency OLEDs.},

abstract = {To achieve efficient organic solar cells, donor and acceptor molecules are mixed in the photoactive layer to form a so-called bulk heterojunction. Due to molecular interactions, a certain degree of phase separation between donor and acceptor domains arises, which is necessary to achieve efficient charge extraction within the absorber layer. However, the mechanism that induces the phase separation is not fully understood and gaining detailed information about the molecular arrangement within these blend layers is quite challenging. We show that grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, combined with variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry is a suitable way to investigate the molecular structure of blend layers in detail, consisting of a mixture of zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and C60. The degree of phase separation within the blend layer is influenced by substrate heating during the co-evaporation of ZnPc and C60 and by a variation of the mixing ratio. The effect of different blend layer morphologies on optical and electrical device performance is investigated by solar cell characterization and mobility measurements. We find that the molecular arrangement of C60 provides the essential driving force for efficient phase separation. Whereas spherical C60 molecules are able to form crystalline domains when deposited at elevated substrate temperatures, no ZnPc crystallites are observed, although the planar ZnPc molecules are not randomly oriented but standing upright within its domains. Comparing specular and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, we find that only the latter method is able to detect nanocrystalline C60 in thin films due to its polycrystalline nature and small sized nanocrystallites. Solar cell measurements show an increase in fill factor and external quantum efficiency signal for blends with enhanced phase separation, induced by higher substrate temperatures. However, grazing incidence x-ray diffraction measurements reveal that ZnPc and C60 already form separate domains in unheated ZnPc:C60 blends, which provide fill factors close to 50\% in the corresponding solar cells.},

abstract = {The role of cocaine as an addictive drug of abuse in human society is hard to reconcile with its ecological role as a natural insecticide and plant-protective compound, preventing herbivory of coca plants (Erythroxylum spp.). This paradox is often explained by proposing a fundamental difference in mammalian and invertebrate responses to cocaine, but here we show effects of cocaine on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) that parallel human responses. Forager honey bees perform symbolic dances to advertise the location and value of floral resources to their nest mates. Treatment with a low dose of cocaine increased the likelihood and rate of bees dancing after foraging but did not otherwise increase locomotor activity. This is consistent with cocaine causing forager bees to overestimate the value of the floral resources they collected. Further, cessation of chronic cocaine treatment caused a withdrawal-like response. These similarities likely occur because in both insects and mammals the biogenic amine neuromodulator systems disrupted by cocaine perform similar roles as modulators of reward and motor systems. Given these analogous responses to cocaine in insects and mammals, we propose an alternative solution to the paradox of cocaine reinforcement. Ecologically, cocaine is an effective plant defence compound via disruption of herbivore motor control but, because the neurochemical systems targeted by cocaine also modulate reward processing, the reinforcing properties of cocaine occur as a ;side effect'.},

We present a study of the controlled passivation of acceptor tail states in fullerene C60 by the addition of electrons introduced by molecular n doping. Using ultralow doping, we are able to successively fill the traps with charges and examine the changes in conductivity, activation energy, mobility, and Fermi-level position. Passivation of the traps leads to an increase of the electron mobility in C60 by more than 3 orders of magnitude, to reach 0.21 cm2/(V s).},

The D-EML is comprised of two layers with ambipolar transport characteristics, both doped with the green phosphorescent dye tris(phenylpyridine)iridium. The D-EML system of two bipolar layers leads to an expansion of the exciton generation region. Due to its self-balancing character, accumulation of charge carriers at the outer interfaces is avoided. Thus, a power efficiency of approximately 77 lm∕W and an external quantum efficiency of 19.3\% are achieved at 100 cd∕m2 with an operating voltage of only 2.65 V. More importantly, the efficiency decays only weakly with increasing brightness, and a power efficiency of 50 lm∕W is still obtained even at 4000 cd∕m2.},

abstract = {We report in situ measurements of dc conductivity versus temperature in polycrystalline films of C60. Films sublimed using C60 powders from different batches synthesized according to standard techniques were used in conductivity versus temperature measurements in the range 20-180 °C. The films showed clear semiconductor behavior. Activation energies Ea and room-temperature dark conductivities $\sigma$ were in the range 0.54-0.58 eV and 10-6-10-7 ($\Omega$ cm)-1, respectively. Exposing the films to pure O2 or air at 21 °C leads to a fast decrease in dark conductivity and photoconductivity by orders of magnitude, indicating that oxygen quickly permeates the whole depth of the films. This indicates that at room temperature O2 quickly diffuses into the bulk of C60 and changes the electronic properties of the material. Most of the effect of oxygen on the conductivity can be reversed in minutes by increasing the temperature of the films to 160-180 °C in vacuum, but the final state has slightly larger resistivity and activation energy. Exposure of C60 films at 21 °C to Ar, N2, and He gases had no effect on $\sigma$. Illumination of the films in the presence of O2 causes larger and faster irreversible changes in $\sigma$ and Ea. In particular, exposing a 165-nm-thick film having $\sigma$(21 °C)∼10-6 ($\Omega$ cm)-1 and Ea=0.54 eV to a white-light intensity of 60 mW/cm2 in 1 atm O2 at 21 °C for 1 h yields a state, after annealing, exhibiting $\sigma$(21 °C)∼10-14 ($\Omega$ cm)-1 and Ea=0.95 eV. The effect of pure O2 on the conductivity of solid C60 can be explained in terms of a disorder potential that leads to localization of the electronic states at the edges of the highest-occupied-molecular-orbital- and lowest-unoccupied-molecular-orbital-derived bands. In addition, oxygen may act as an efficient trap for electrons in the conduction band of C60. Illumination of the samples in the presence of oxygen promotes C-O reactions that irreversibly damage the C60 molecules, producing carbon dangling bonds and other defects that possibly generate gap-defect states in the semiconductor. The results of the present study also suggest that measured optical properties of C60 in the low-photon-energy range may be affected by oxygen contamination and strong light.},

abstract = {In contrast to p-dopants, highly efficient molecular n-dopants are prone to degradation in air due to their low ionization potentials, limiting the processing conditions of doped functional organic devices. In this contribution, we investigate the air-stability of pure films of the n-dopant tetrakis(1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidinato)ditungsten(II) (inline image) and of inline image layers doped by inline image. We find that 1/3 of the initial conductivity of the doped C60 thin films can be restored by thermal annealing in vacuum after a drop by 5 orders of magnitude upon air exposure. Furthermore, we show by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and Seebeck measurements that the Fermi level shift toward the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60 remains after air exposure, clearly indicating a conservation of n-doping. We explain these findings by a down-shift of the W2(hpp)4 energy levels upon charge-transfer to a host material with deeper lying energy-levels, facilitating a protection against oxidation in air. Consequently, the observed recovery of the conductivity can be understood in terms of a self-passivation of the molecular n-doping. Hence, an application of highly efficient n-doped thin films in functional organic devices handled even under ambient conditions during fabrication is feasible.},

abstract = {High-efficiency thermoelectric (TE) materials are important for power-generation devices that are designed to convert waste heat into electrical energy.They can also be used in solid-state refrigeration devices.The conversion of waste heat into electrical energy may play an important role in our current challenge to develop alternative energy technologies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An overview of various TE phenomena and materials is provided in this issue of MRS Bulletin. Several of the current applications and key parameters are defined and discussed.Novel applications of TE materials include biothermal batteries to power heart pacemakers, enhanced performance of optoelectronics coupled with solid-state TE cooling, and power generation for deep-space probes via radioisotope TE generators.A number of different systems of potential TE materials are currently under investigation by various research groups around the world, and many of these materials are reviewed in the articles in this issue.These range from thin-film superlattice materials to large single-crystal or polycrystalline bulk materials, and from semiconductors and semimetals to ceramic oxides.The phonon-glass/electron-crystal approach to new TE materials is presented, along with the role of solid-state crystal chemistry.Research criteria for developing new materials are highlighted.},

We explore several amine-Au and pyridine-Au linked molecules that are predicted to conduct through either the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), respectively. We find that the Seebeck coefficient is negative for pyridine-Au linked LUMO-conducting junctions and positive for amine-Au linked HOMO-conducting junctions. Within the accessible temperature gradients (<30 K), we do not observe a strong dependence of the junction Seebeck coefficient on temperature. From histograms of thousands of junctions, we use the most probable Seebeck coefficient to determine a power factor, GS(2), for each junction studied, and find that GS(2) increases with G. Finally, we find that conductance and Seebeck coefficient values are in good quantitative agreement with our self-energy corrected density functional theory calculations.},

Electrical measurements show that doping effects at low concentration strongly depend on the work function of the introduced metal, and not every metal works as an efficient dopant. Practical applicability is demonstrated by introducing doped transport layers in prototypical bilayer solar cells in conventional and inverted architectures.},

abstract = {We constructed an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system with which in-situ conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements can be performed, including the detailed examination of the oxygen effect. It can also carry out the deposition of metal electrodes and organic films under UHV condition through measurements. The conductive characteristics of fullerene (C60) films were examined by the measurement at conductivity and Seebeck coefficient under UHV. We observed that the conductivity at room temperature was higher than 1×10-3 S cm-1. This value is two orders of magnitude in conductivity higher than the Hamed’s report. [A. Hamed et al., Phys. Rev. B 47, 10873 (1993).] Seebeck coefficient S was also measured. Its sign was negative, indicating electron conduction for C60 film. After the measurements under UHV, oxygen was introduced into the chamber by a variable leak valve. The conductivity decreased drastically by increasing the pressure of oxygen. It decreased more than five orders from under UHV to 1 atom oxygen. The temperature dependence of the conductivity was also examined. The conductivity was thermally activated. Activation energies of the conductivity increase by increase oxygen pressure. This means that the oxygen act as carrier traps. As an n-type dopant, acridine orange base (AOB) was co-deposited into C60 films. The magnitude in the conductivity increased but not drastic. The conductivity of doped film also decreased by increasing the pressure of oxygen. The conductivity even under 6.6×10-2 Pa, however, was high enough. Though AOB was not effective dopant against C60 film in UHV condition, AOB doped C60 film became resistant to oxygen.},

We demonstrate imaging of molecules with unprecedented atomic resolution by probing the short-range chemical forces with use of noncontact atomic force microscopy. The key step is functionalizing the microscope's tip apex with suitable, atomically well-defined terminations, such as CO molecules. Our experimental findings are corroborated by ab initio density functional theory calculations. Comparison with theory shows that Pauli repulsion is the source of the atomic resolution, whereas van der Waals and electrostatic forces only add a diffuse attractive background.},

We show here that the application of a positive gate bias leads to the formation of a depletion layer, and a subsequent decrease of the drain current. We develop an analytical model for this depletion mode of the OFET. It is shown that measurements in the depletion mode give access to parameters such as the doping level and the density of trap levels. The model is applied to data obtained on sexithiophene (6T) film and single crystal OFETs. A substantial amount of traps is found in unsubstituted 6T, whereas the dihexyl substituted 6T is practically trap free. 6T single crystals are characterized by a very low doping level, which can be related to their very high purity. The possible use of the depletion mode to increase the on-off current ratio of OFETs is discussed.},

abstract = {A study on p-doping of organic wide band gap materials with Molybdenum trioxide using current transport measurements, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy is presented. When MoO3 is co-evaporated with 4,4′-Bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP), a significant increase in conductivity is observed, compared to intrinsic CBP thin films. This increase in conductivity is due to electron transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital of the host molecules to very low lying unfilled states of embedded Mo3O9 clusters. The energy levels of these clusters are estimated by the energy levels of a neat MoO3 thin film with a work function of 6.86 eV, an electron affinity of 6.7 eV and an ionization energy of 9.68 eV. The Fermi level of MoO3-doped CBP and N,N′-bis(1-naphtyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine ($\alpha$-NPD) thin films rapidly shifts with increasing doping concentration towards the occupied states. Pinning of the Fermi level several 100 meV above the HOMO edge is observed for doping concentrations higher than 2 mol\% and is explained in terms of a Gaussian density of HOMO states. We determine a relatively low dopant activation of ∼0.5\%, which is due to Coulomb-trapping of hole carriers at the ionized dopant sites.},

The measured coefficients—resistivity, Hall, Seebeck, and Nernst—are applied to solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation to give information about the film’s density-of-states effective mass, the Fermi energy level, and an energy-dependent scattering parameter. The machine is designed to eliminate or compensate for simultaneously occurring transport phenomena that would interfere with the desired measured quantity, while allowing for all four coefficients to be measured on the same sample. An average density-of-states effective mass value of 0.29±0.04me was measured on the transparent conductive oxide, cadmium stannate (CTO), over a carrier concentration range of 2-7×1020 cm−3. This effective mass value matched previous results obtained by optical and thermoelectric modeling. The measured scattering parameter indicates that neutral impurities or a mixture of scattering mechanisms may inhibit the transport of carriers in CTO},

Previous IPES methods have had two serious weaknesses, i.e. low energy resolution and sample damage to organic materials. In the present method, on the other hand, the irradiation damage to the organic sample is significantly reduced by decreasing the kinetic energy of electrons below the damage threshold. The energy resolution of the instrument is improved by a factor of two to 0.3 eV by using multilayer band pass filters. Acceptor materials widely used in organic photovoltaic cells, C60 and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), are measured with this new technique to determine the electron affinities.},

@article{Riede2011,
abstract = {In this paper, two vacuum processed single heterojunction organic solar cells with complementary absorption are described and the construction and optimization of tandem solar cells based on the combination of these heterojunctions demonstrated. The red-absorbing heterojunction consists of C60 and a fluorinated zinc phthalocyanine derivative (F4-ZnPc) that leads to a 0.1-0.15 V higher open circuit voltage Voc than the commonly used ZnPc. The second heterojunction incorporates C60 and a dicyanovinyl-capped sexithiophene derivative (DCV6T) that mainly absorbs in the green. The combination of both heterojunctions into one tandem solar cell leads to an absorption over the whole visible range of the sun spectrum. Thickness variations of the transparent p-doped optical spacer between both subcells in the tandem solar cell is shown to lead to a significant change in short circuit current density jsc due to optical interference effects, whereas Voc and fill factor are hardly affected. The maximum efficiency $\eta$ of about 5.6\% is found for a spacer thickness of 150-165 nm. Based on the optimized 165nm thick spacer, effects of intensity and angle of illumination, and temperature on a tandem device are investigated. Variations in illumination intensity lead to a linear change in jsc over three orders of magnitude and a nearly constant $\eta$ in the range of 30 to 310 mW cm−2. Despite the stacked heterojunctions, the performance of the tandem device is robust against different illumination angles: jsc and $\eta$ closely follow a cosine behavior between 0° and 70°. Investigations of the temperature behavior of the tandem device show an increase in $\eta$ of 0.016 percentage points per Kelvin between −20 °C and 25 °C followed by a plateau up to 50 °C. Finally, further optimization of the tandem stack results in a certified $\eta$ of (6.07 ± 0.24)\% on (1.9893 ± 0.0060)cm2 (Fraunhofer ISE), i.e., areas large enough to be of relevance for modules.},

abstract = {We report on transparent stand alone C60 top electrodes for small molecule based organic photovoltaic cells. All device layers (including bottom and top electrode) are thermally evaporated in vacuum, guaranteeing fast, reliable, high-purity and low-cost processing. Employing an organic compound as electrode avoids refractive index mismatch between contact and photo-active layer which results in an increased number of photons reaching the absorber layers. The conductivity of C60 is improved from 10−8 S/cm to remarkable 4.97 S/cm by optimized molecular n-type doping. Furthermore, it is shown that high doping concentrations change the absorption behavior of C60, leading to transmittance values over 70\% for wavelengths larger than 600 nm with a weak dependence on layer thickness. Organic solar cells employing such an optimized n-doped C60 top electrode (thickness 200 nm, doping concentration 16 wt\%) exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 1.53\%. Electrical device simulations based on a discretized equivalent circuit model reveal an efficient lateral charge transport in n-doped C60 electrodes over a few 100 µm. In combination with a supporting grid electrode (usually employed for large area photovoltaic applications), n-doped C60 might replace ITO and fill the lack of transparent conductive top electrodes required for roll-to-roll processed semi-transparent organic devices or devices on opaque substrates.},

abstract = {We report on direct high lateral resolution measurements of density of states in pentacene thin film transistors using Kelvin probe force microscopy. The measurements were conducted on passivated (hexamethyldisilazane) and unpassivated field effect transistors with 10- and 30-nm-thick pentacene polycrystalline layers. The analysis takes into account both the band bending in the organic film and the trapped charge at the SiO2-pentacene interface. We found that the density of states for the highest occupied molecular orbital band of pentacene film on the treated substrate is Gaussian with a width (variance) of $\sigma$=0.07±0.01 eV and an exponential tail. The concentration of the density of states in the gap for pentacene on bare SiO2 substrate was larger by one order of magnitude, had a different energy distribution, and induced Fermi level pinning. The results are discussed in view of their effect on pentacene thin film transistors’ performance.},
